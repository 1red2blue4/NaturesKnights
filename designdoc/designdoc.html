	<h2>Abstract</h2>	
	<p>Nature's Knights is a two-player turn-based game where the players 
	each get a team of low-scaling characters with strengths and weaknesses,
	order themselves in a line, and battle .The characters are different animals
    and possess a cartoon-like quality. This game is highly inspired by Paper
    Mario: The Thousand Year Door, both in simplistic art style and mechanics.
    The player has a team of five characters and they fight each other. Specific
    stats have unique features, like flying, defense, or what enemies it can target.
    Move order is based upon speed, one of the stats of the character. Speed 
    determines quite a few of the server calculations.</p> 
	<h2>Proud Moments</h2>
	<p>The game has a decently smooth UI and good page design, despite being a short
    page. I composed music for the game, which can be found in the bottom right corner of the game.
    It also feels very much like a complete game with great potential for improvement.
    In fact, there are entire portions of code that are useless for the game right now
    but would be important if I wanted to continue working on it, and I definitely want
    to continue working on it. Despite how bad the artwork may be, I'm also proud that
    I found the opportunity to do that myself.</p>
    <h2>Shortcomings</h2>
    <p>There are still a few UI bugs I can't figure out, like characters shaking as if
    they got hit when they should not be. It has no effect on the mechanics though. It 
    also isn't a game with great replay value, as both players currently get a mirror 
    map of characters. Only five characters are in the game right now.</p>
	<h2>Future Work</h2>
	<p>Boy, where do I start? I want to add poison and burning as features, as well as
    spiked enemies. And more special features characters can possess keep cropping up
    in my head. I'd like to add more attack types and sound effects for attacks to add to
    immersion. I absolutely need to create more characters to make a more dynamic game.</p>
	<h2>Multi-User</h2>
	<p>To play the game, you are given a ticket when you enter the game. The server keeps
    track of whether you are an odd or even tickeet, and assigns you to the corresponding
    enemy. I've found it's a bit frustrating to get players to be in the right state before
    starting a game, but once it starts the game is a nice, short, and sweet iteration cycle
    and you can join another game. The end result is a series of rooms with 1v1 games in each
    one.</p>
